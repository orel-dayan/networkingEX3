## Description
In this project, we compared two tcp congestion control algorithms - Reno and Cubic. We examined their coping in different network conditions. We have simulated different network conditions by using packet loss software.
with the packet loss software, we examined several percentages of packet losses: 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%.

The code includes a server and a client. The client sends a 2 mega file to the server. He sends the file in two halves. One half uses the Reno algorithm, and the other half uses the Cubic algorithm. Our conclusions are presented in the PDF file. 

The client will be able to send the file as many times as he wants, which will help base conclusions on the performance of each algorithm.
